Dependency wheels and sankey diagrams can be drawn by many R Packages, such as [circlize](https://github.com/jokergoo/circlize), [networkD3](http://christophergandrud.github.io/networkD3/), and [ggalluvial](https://github.com/corybrunson/ggalluvial). These packages are very powerful and easy to use, so why bother to write another duplicate package? As we can see, there are some relationships exist between dependency wheels and sankey diagrams. So why not combined these two types of charts into one R function. At the same time, it would be great to add a little interactivity to the graph. ['Highcharts'](http://www.highcharts.com/), a commercial javascript charting library, can help me realize these ideas. By binding R functions and the 'Highcharts' charting library, 'sankeywheel' package provides a simple way to draw dependency wheels and sankey diagrams.

First, you can install it from `CRAN` or `GitHub`:

```r
devtools::install_github('czxa/sankeywheel', build_vignettes = TRUE)
# or just use git
devtools::install_git("https://github.com/czxa/sankeywheel.git", build_vignettes = TRUE)

# CRAN
install.packages("sankeywheel")
```

## Basic Usages

First, load `sankeywheel` package:

```{r}
library(sankeywheel)
```

There is a demo dataset built in this R packages. 

`sankeydf` is a tibble data frame with 46 rows and 3 variables:

```{r}
DT::datatable(sankeydf)
```

To draw dependency wheels and sankey diagrams, you need there vector, two character vectors and one numeric vector: from, to and weight.

For dependency wheels:

```{r}
sankeywheel(from = sankeydf$from,
            to = sankeydf$to,
            weight = sankeydf$weight,
            type = "dependencywheel", 
            width = "100%")
```

For sankey diagrams:

```{r}
sankeywheel(from = sankeydf$from,
            to = sankeydf$to,
            weight = sankeydf$weight,
            type = "sankey", 
            width = "100%")
```


## Theme parameter

I hate complex codes, so I built some themes in this package. Just change theme parameter, you can render charts in different apperances.

If there are multiple charts created by this package in a RMarkdown document, use topic parameters carefully, because these charts may interfere with each other.

The default theme is `sandsignika`. There are other eight theme you can choose: darkgreen/darkblue/avocado/darkunica/gray/gridlight/grid/sunset:

```{r}
library(manipulateWidget)
combineWidgets(
  sankeywheel(from = sankeydf$from,
            to = sankeydf$to,
            weight = sankeydf$weight,
            type = "sankey", 
            width = "100%",
            theme = "sunset", 
            title = "SUNSET"),
  sankeywheel(from = sankeydf$from,
            to = sankeydf$to,
            weight = sankeydf$weight,
            type = "dependencywheel", 
            width = "100%", 
            theme = "sunset", 
            title = "SUNSET"),
  byrow = TRUE, ncol = 2, width = "100%", height = "300px"
)
```

## Other parameters

Here is a complete example:

```{r}
sankeywheel(from = sankeydf$from,
            to = sankeydf$to,
            weight = sankeydf$weight,
            type = "dependencywheel", 
            seriesName = "Random data: ",
            width = "100%", 
            height = "400px",
            theme = "sunset", 
            title = "SUNSET",
            titleAlign = "center",
            titleSize = "18px",
            titleColor = "black",
            subtitle = "czxa.top",
            subtitleAlign = "center",
            subtitleSize = "14px",
            subtitleColor = "black")
```

## Use it in 'RMarkdown' and 'Shiny' Apps

Here is a very simple 'shiny' example:

```{r eval=FALSE, include=TRUE}
dir <- system.file("examples", "sankeywheel", package = "sankeywheel")
setwd(dir)
shiny::shinyAppDir(".")
```
